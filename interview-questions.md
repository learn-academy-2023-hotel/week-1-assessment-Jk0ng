# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the tecnology to keep version control and it is good for programmers to use becasue of its ability to keep track of the progress that inividual programmers make on the code without merging back to the main source code. the difference between git and Github is git is the tecnology, and github is the platform that is most commonly used for programmers to collaborate. Git is local level, and github is remote.  

Researched answer:Git is the technoloy that was created by the creator of Linux system in 2005 to serve the function of keeping verion control. Programmers can use git technology to make named timeline code called branch. branching from the main branch, feature branch allows programmers to make edits without affecting the source of code and testing out applicaitons without having to merge into main. Github is the most widely used online platform for programmers to share, store their code in a remote virtual place. The rest of the team can access the new feature branch that other programmers make. 

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an array's index is the location of the data which indicates where in the array is the data located. The valus is the actual data that is held in the array. For example, [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, "a", "b", "c"], for index, each data is assigned to an index number starting from 0; thisArray[0] is 4, and the value of console.log(thisArray[0]) is the data itself 4 in this case

Researched answer: value is the content of the element in arrays, and the index is the location of the element in the array and start with 0 and increase by 1. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: strings is one of the six primary data types that javascript recognizes. and arrays are a collect of data which can include number, strings, and more arrays. The fundamental diffference between arrays and strings is their properties. some functions only apply to arrays like .reverse(). and some built-in functions only apply to strings but not arrays like .toUpperCase(). 

Researched answer: an array is an collection of data in javascript and it consists five parts: variable declaration, variable name, single qeual sign, open brackets, and comma to separate elements in the array. for example, var nameOfArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, "a" "b", "c" ]. string is a primitive date type and holds charaters, space and punctuation marks inside "". 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The four pillars are polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance. Polymorphism means that data can take on different shapes. Using an analogy to explain this, like data, cars can take on different shapes. 

Encapsulation means that all the content needed is inside the data structure and the users doesn't have to access the inner part to operate the system. For example, in the car analogy, drivers don't have to reach inside the hood to start the engine every time, rather they can simply just press the start button or insert the key to start the car. 

Abstraction means that complex logic is reduced to simple logci and represented in the most characteristic way. The example with the car would be the dirvers don't have to know the ins and outs of a car but still able to drive the cars. 

Inheritance means the one class can share some methods and attributes from another class. For example, Toyota can have several editions for Sienna but the highest edition has both attributes derived from a base model and more exlusive features.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: 
Higher order functions are built-in methods for arrays that can take built-in functions as arguments such as .map() and .(filter). 

2. Jest:
Jest is a Javascript testing framework that enables prgorammers to run quality assessment on the code. There are many dependecies which act like files in Jest. Managaging dependencies can be challenging, so in 2016, Facebook created a package mamager to manage all the dependencies. 

3. Objects:
Objects in JavaScript is a collection of data that can be static information as well as actions. The collections are key:stored data. For example, an object can look like this, const objectA = {name1 : "value1", name2 : "value2'}.
